To-Do List App (Python CLI)

Description:
This is a simple command-line To-Do List application built with Python. It allows users to manage their daily tasks through a menu interface. 
The app demonstrates Python fundamentals like loops, conditionals, functions, lists, and error handling.

Features:
- Add Tasks: Enter a task description to add to the list.
- View Tasks: Displays all current tasks in a numbered format.
- Delete Tasks: Removes a task by selecting its corresponding number.
- Quit: Exits the application safely.
- Error Handling: Alerts the user about invalid input, empty lists, or out-of-range task selections.

I organized my code into functions to improve clarity and maintainability, and used descriptive function names and add comments/docstrings where necessary.
I thoroughly tested my application, considering edge cases such as empty lists and invalid input.
