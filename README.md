To-Do List App (Python CLI)

I have built a simple command-line To-Do List application with Python. It allows users to manage their daily tasks through a menu interface. 
The app demonstrates Python fundamentals like loops, conditionals, functions, lists, and error handling.

Features:
- Add Tasks: Enter a task description to add to the list.
- View Tasks: Displays all current tasks in a numbered format.
- Delete Tasks: Removes a task by selecting its corresponding number.
- Quit: Exits the application safely.
- Error Handling: Alerts the user about invalid input, empty lists, or out-of-range task selections.

I organized my code into functions to improve clarity and maintainability.
I captured and validated user input using input() and try/except.
I thoroughly tested my application, writing readable and maintainable logic for CLI applications.
